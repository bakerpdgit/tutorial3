# Map, filter, and reduce

## Exercise 5 (task)

As it turns out, `filter` is a special case of `reduce`. That is, there is a function `prepare_predicate` and an
initial value `init` such that for every predicate `f` and list `l`, the expression `list(filter(f, l))` is equivalent
to `reduce(prepare_predicate(f), l, init)`.

First, find the appropriate value of `init` by considering under what conditions
`reduce(perpare_predicate(f), l, init) == init` regardless of `prepare_predicate`.

Then, implement `prepare_predicate`.

(This is a hard exercise!)
