# Map, filter, and reduce

## Exercise 4 (example)

The last builtin higher-order list function is called `filter`. Filter takes a predicate (a function which
returns a boolean) and a list, applies the predicate to each element in the list, and yields every element for which the
predicate returns `True`.

As with `map`, `filter`'s return value is a generator rather than a list, so you may need to call `list` on the result
to get back all values at once.

See the examples opposite for usage.
