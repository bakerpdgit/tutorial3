# Constructors and Association

## Exercise 4 (task)

Fill in the blanks to make a `Student` class, and a `Department` class which contains a list of `Student`s via aggregation.

Once the tests pass, notice what happens when we try to *delete* the `Department` object and try to access the students that were added - it would still work as the objects are related via **aggregation**.

The `__repr__` method is a **special method** that returns a *string representation* of the object. Like the constructor `__init__`, it is automatically added when using *dataclasses* - without a string representation, printing the object will result in a memory address.
