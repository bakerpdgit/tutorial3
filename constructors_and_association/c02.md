# Constructors and Association

## Exercise 2 (task)

Write the constructor for this class to calculate the following attributes based on the constructor parameters provided.

- length and height attributes should be calculated by subtracting the first corresponding coordinate value from the second
- The constructor should accept a colour name but a colour attribute should be filled by looking up that name in the dictionary
  `Rectangle.COLOURS`
- After all attributes have been set, the `draw` method should be called at the end of the constructor
