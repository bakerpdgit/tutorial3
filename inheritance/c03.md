# Inheritance

## Exercise 3 (task)

Create a new superclass `Planet` for the three classes opposite. It should contain all the shared behaviour of those
classes, including the constructor. Make the other classes extend `Planet` and remove the methods from them that have
been extracted to `Planet`.
