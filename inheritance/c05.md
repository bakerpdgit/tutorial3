# Inheritance

## Exercise 5 (task)

Write the new class `DeluxePrinter`, a subclass of `Printer`. The deluxe model has the following changes:
- The constructor should no longer have the `border_style` argument. Instead, the superconstructor should be called with
`"fancy"` always passed in as the second argument. `paper_size` should be forwarded as normal.
- The deluxe model treats paper as a subscription service and should automatically buy more if the `print` method fails
because there's not enough space. The `print` method of `Printer` will need to be called twice in `DexluePrinter.print`,
once to attempt the initial print, capturing the return value of whether it succeeded, and once after automatically
buying paper if the first print failed.
- The new method `charge_credits` has been written for you. `restock` should be inherited unchanged from the superclass.
