# Inheritance

## Exercise 1 (example)

One of the advantages of OOP is **polymorphism**, the ability to use instances of different classes in the same way. For
instance, these three animal classes all have the attribute `name` and all have the `get_sound` method with the same
arguments and return type.

The set of members that a class exposes is called its **interface**. (We'll see in the next section that a class
needn't expose all of its members.) On a large project, polymorphism allows one programmer to program classes with a
particular interface, while another uses that interface without needing to know anything about the class beyond its
interface.

The functions presented work no matter which of the three classes its argument belongs to.
