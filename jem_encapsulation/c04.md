# Encapsulation

## Exercise 4 (task)

Rewrite this code to make all attributes private and use getter and setter methods instead. Getters and setters should
be created only where needed â€“ so no getter/setter if the attribute is not read/set from outside the class â€“ and should
have the tightest access restrictions possible while still allowing the code to run.

Since there are a lot of members to rename, you may wish to use the find and replace tool on your browser, or copy the
code to another editor before editing. Some editors can even autocomplete getter and setter methods for you.

>>> Language note: Python has an extra feature, using the @property decorator to write getter and setter methods which
> are invoked automatically with the same syntax as attribute access. In theory, this means regular attributes can be
> used without guilt if no additional behaviour is needed, since switching from a regular attribute to an @property can
> be done when needed without breaking any calling code. Most languages do not have this feature so getters and setters
> are still needed.
