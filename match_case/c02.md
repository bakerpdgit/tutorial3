# Match... case... statements

## Exercise 2 (task)

The final case of a match statement can be a default case that will always match â€“ equivalent to an `else` statement
at the end of a chain of `elif`s:
```python
match input("Enter an animal to hear its noise: "):
  case "cat":
    print("Meow")
  case "dog":
    print("Woof")
  case "horse":
    print("Neigh")
  case animal:
    print(f"I don't know what sound a {animal} makes")
```

Here the value on which we are matching is assigned to the variable `animal` in the case pattern. If you don't need the
value, you can use the "variable name" `_`, which won't be assigned to:
```python
match input("Enter an animal to hear its noise: "):
  case "cat":
    print("Meow")
  case "dog":
    print("Woof")
  case "horse":
    print("Neigh")
  case _:
    print(f"I don't know what sound that animal makes")
```

Rewrite each of the `if` statements opposite as `match` statements. Use `_` for default cases if you don't need the
value, and remember to put default cases last.
