# Match... case... statements

## Exercise 3 (example)

The true power of `match` statements comes from pattern matching. Instead of just checking equality, you can check for
a certain structure, capturing parts of that structure into variables. For instance, a `case` clause could match all
tuples of two elements where the first element is a particular string, and capture the second element to a variable.
There are loads of examples opposite.

When multiple `case` clauses could match a value, only the first one that matches is executed (which is why default
clauses have to be last).

Experiment by modifying the values on which we are matching, to see which cases are executed.
