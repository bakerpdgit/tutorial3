# Match... case... statements

## Exercise 1 (example)

Sometimes you have a long cascade of `if... else...` statements like this:

```python
animal = input("Enter an animal to hear its noise: ")
if animal == "cat":
  print("Meow")
elif animal == "dog":
  print("Woof")
elif animal == "horse":
  print("Neigh")
elif animal == "monkey":
  print("Oo oo aa aa")
```

Repeating `animal ==` on every line is tedious and increases the risk of errors. Statements of this form can be
simplified to

```python
match input("Enter an animal to hear its noise: "):
  case "cat":
    print("Meow")
  case "dog":
    print("Woof")
  case "horse":
    print("Neigh")
  case "monkey":
    print("Oo oo aa aa")
```

Note that by only referring to the animal once, we don't need to assign it to a variable.

Various languages have statements like this, usually called `match`, `switch`, or `case`.
