# Match... case... statements

## Exercise 5 (example)

You can use pipes `|` to match multiple patterns in the same clause, including inside another pattern:
```python
match [input("Enter an animal to hear its noise: "), input("Enter something else useless: ")]:
  case ["dog" | "wolf" | "jackal" | "dhole", *_]:
    print("Woof")
```

If you want to both extract a value such as a tuple, and extract or check its components, you can use the `as` keyword,
again including inside another pattern:
```python
match ("Foo", "Bar"):
  case ("Foo", bar) as the_tuple:
      print(bar, the_tuple)
```

Finally, you can use a guard clause to check additional properties of the values you extract:
```python
match {"name": "Romeo Montague", "age": 16, "likes": "fighting Capulets"}:
    case {"age": age, "name": name} if age >= 16:
        print(f"{name} is at least 16 years old")
    case _:
        print("This service is only for ages 16 and up")
```
