# Inheritance

## Exercise 4 (example)

Sometimes a class has programmatic and conceptual reasons to extend a particular superclass, but one or two of that
class's methods should not be inherited directly. We may want to replace the implementation of a particular method, or
add code before or after the superclass's implementation.

For instance, a ringed planet like Saturn shouldn't count the mass of its rings towards its main density, so it needs a
different implementation for `get_density`. The superclass's method is **overridden** simply by redefining the method
in the subclass.

We also want to change the behaviour of `establish_orbital_base` to mention the rings, but we don't want to replace the
original behaviour, only add to it. To reproduce the original behaviour we need to call the original method â€“ but we
also want to override that method which makes it impossible to call directly. To refer to the original method we invoke
it from a special object called `super()`. The function `super` involves a bit of trickery so don't worry about the
mechanics; just observe the syntax opposite.

In the constructor, we again use `super()` to invoke the superclass's constructor, or **superconstructor**. Observe that
the overriding method doesn't have to have the same arguments as the original; in Python, this applies to all methods.
Unlike other methods, constructors must always call the superconstructor to ensure the initial state of the object is
valid.
