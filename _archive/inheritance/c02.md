# Inheritance

## Exercise 2 (example)

There are a few problems with this approach to polymorphism. The three classes share a lot of properties:
- Shared code
- Shared attributes
- Shared method signatures
- Similar conceptual purpose (representing animals)
but none of this is made explicit in the program:
- Shared code needs to be copied and pasted between classes
- Code using these classes has no way to refer to all animal classes together (less important in Python than other
  languages but matters, for instance, for dataclasses)
- Nothing in the code represents the conceptual relationship

The solution to these problems is **inheritance**. We extract the shared behaviour into a new class and instruct the
original classes to copy, or inherit, the behaviour from that class. The new class is called the **superclass** and the
classes which inherit from it, or **extend** it, are **subclasses**. Observe the syntax opposite.
