# Introduction to object-oriented programming

## Exercise 1 (example)

> This is the **first** chapter on OOP

Asking **what** *object-oriented programming* is often results in a nomenclature-heavy unintuitive definition; instead we should ask **why** *object-oriented programming* is used and what does it achieve.

This example details a *simple* tic-tac-toe game made using best **procedural programming** practices - *no global variables*, *use of functions*, *good variable names* etc., and yet the code is still verbose and disorganised:

1. function names are verbose, like `board_make_move`; `make_move` on its own is ambiguous especially in a large codebase with many features.
2. functions take many arguments - making it difficult to call and work with; this is used to avoid **global variables**. Note that most variables are related to the board itself.
3. there is no notion of a **board** namespace that encloses all *board-related* variables and functions

We could contain *board-related* variables inside a `board_state` tuple, e.g.

```python3
board_state : (list[list[str]], str)
def board_make_move(board_state: (list[list[str]], str), row: int, col: int) -> bool:
```

But accessing attributes requires indexing, e.g. `board_state[0]` to get the grid - it isn't clear that `0` corresponds to the grid.

What if we could combine `board_state` and all *board-related functions* into a single **board object**?

### Note

All chapters on **OOP** use *type annotations* - read more [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-type-annotation-python/)
