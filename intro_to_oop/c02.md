# Introduction to object-oriented programming

## Exercise 2 (task)

In Python, an **object** refers to anything that can be stored in a variable: `3`, `"carrot"`, `12j+3` (a complex number), `(3, 5, "carrot")`, and `set((3, 5, "carrot"))` are various different objects.

Each object has a **type**: these objects, respectively, have types `int`, `str`, `complex`, `tuple`, and `set`.

In real-world codebases we sometimes want to define our **own data types** to represent *real-world objects*. There are different ways to do this - but the *object-oriented* approach is with **classes**.

A **class** is simply the *blueprint* of an object - it tells how to *create* the object, and the *type* of that object is the *class*. Two objects may have the same **class** but are different, e.g. `5` and `6` belong to the `int` class, but are different!

If you've completed *Creating and using records* from the A-Level content, you would know that *records* (`dataclass`) can solve one issue with `board_state` seen in the last example. Classes, including dataclasses, have much more functionality than pure records.

For now, refresh your memory of syntax by filling in the blanks.
