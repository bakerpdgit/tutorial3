# Introduction to object-oriented programming

## Exercise 3 (example)

A *dataclass* provides a good way of storing information about a real-world object - for example the Tic Tac Toe board contains the grid and the player's turn.

The use of **enums** (grouped named constants) made it clear that the *player's turn* is not just a string, it is a `Player` data type.

The use of a **dataclass** for the `BoardState` reduced the complexity of the function's signature whilst keeping code easy to read - `board.grid` and `board.turn` are a lot more self-explanatory than `board_state[0]` and `board_state[1]`.

But objects also have **behaviours** - a board can make a move, or check if there is a winner. Currently, we implement the behaviours of a *data type* as **functions** as shown, but this can become messy as the codebase gets larger:

1. there is **no explicit link** between the record and a function
2. different objects may have behaviours with the same name but different implementations - would cause naming conflicts (hence why we added **board** to the function name)
3. Reusing the code in a different file requires importing every function individually

Classes allow *related functions* to be enclosed within the class along with the variables - such functions are called **methods**.
