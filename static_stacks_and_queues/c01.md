# Static Stacks and Queues

## Exercise 1 (example)

Stacks are a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure that can be implemented either statically or dynamically. In this exercise, we focus on implementing stacks statically using an array. Since there are no true arrays in python, we represent this using a list with a fixed size, as static data structures cannot change their size at runtime.

Static stacks require one pointer - the top pointer to signify where is the top of the stack. Since static stacks have a maximum size given by the maximum size of the array, if an item is pushed to a stack which is already full, there would be a stack overflow error.

As a reminder, here are the main methods associated with a stack:
- `push`: add an item to the stack
- `pop`: remove an item from the stack and return it
- `peek`: return the item at the top of the stack without removing it
- `isEmpty`: checks if the stack is empty
- `isFull`: checks if the stack is full, only applicable for a static stack

In exercise 1, there is an example implementation of a static stack.
