# Static Stacks and Queues

## Exercise 2 (task)

One application of a stack is to check if an bracket expression is balanced.
- This means that each open bracket has a corresponding close bracket
- Brackets must close in the right order - i.e. The most recently opened bracket is the first one to close

Complete the code to determine whether an inputted bracket expression is balanced.
