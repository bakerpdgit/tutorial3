# Static Stacks and Queues

## Exercise 3 (example)

Queues on the other hand, are a First In First Out (FIFO) data strucutre, which again can be implemented statically or dynamically. In this set of exercises, we focus on implementing static queues in two different ways: Linear Queues and Circular Queues. Again, we will be using fixed-length python-lists to represent an array.

Linear Queues are the simplest implementation of a static queue:
- Two pointers are maintained: head, tail
- When we enqeueue an item, we store it at the "tail" end of the queue, and move the tail pointer.
- When we dequeue an item, we return the item at the "head" end of the queue, and move the head pointer.

As a reminder, here are the main operations associated with a queue:
- `enqueue`: add an item to the queue
- `dequeue`: remove an item from the queue
- `isEmpty`: checks if the queue is empty
- `isFull`: checks if the queue is full, only applicable for static queues

This exercise demonstrates an implementation of a static linear queue.
