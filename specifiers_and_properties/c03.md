# Specifiers and Properties

## Exercise 3 (example)

Often, traditional getters and setters of the form `get_<attribute>` and `set_<attribute>` are verbose and not *pythonic*. Hence, a better way to implement *getters* and *setters* is using **properties**.

**Getters** are denoted by the `@property` decorator, and **setters** are denoted by the `@<method name>.setter` decorator. This allows us to get and set attributes without using methods, which is more concise and clear.

This can be particularly useful if you have previously implemented a public attribute but now wish to hide it: you could then create a new private or protected attribute but add a property with the same name as the old public attribute so that your legacy code which uses your class continues working.
