# Functional programming

## Exercise 3 (example)

**Composition** is an operation applied to two unary functions (functions of one argument) to create a third unary
function. The composition of two functions is the single function that chains those two functions together, using the
output of one as the input of the other.

Formally, the composition of functions `f` and `g` is written `f ∘ g` and pronounced "f compose g". Then for an input
`x`, we have that `(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))`.

For example, if `f(x) = 2x + 4` and `g(x) = 3x + 3`, then `(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(3x + 3) = 2(3x + 3) + 4 = 6x + 10`.

Note the order in which we write the functions. Even though `f` is written before `g`, it is applied after `g`.
