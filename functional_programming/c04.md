# Functional programming

## Exercise 4 (task)

Identify which functions opposite may be composed to form `drop_two`, `drop_last`, and `del_first_word`, replacing the
underscores in the print statements with the names of the relevant functions. (Don't express a function as the
composition of itself and other functions.)

Implement `delete_last_word` as the composition of six of the functions opposite. That is, the body should be of the
form `return f(g(h(i(j(k(string)))))))` for some functions `f, g, h, i, j, k`.
