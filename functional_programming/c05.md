# Functional programming

## Exercise 5 (task)

Composition itself may be expressed as a higher-order function, which inputs two functions and outputs a function.

Implement the function `compose` to this purpose, that satisfies `compose(f, g)(x) = f(g(x))`.

As is done in exercise 2, you will need to define one function inside another, in order to return it.
