# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 1 (example)

> This is the **fourth** chapter on OOP

Due to the principle of _encapsulation_ in OOP, **every class** has an _interface_ - the public methods that a class exposes. Recall that we **only need** the class' _interface_ to be able to **use its objects** externally.

This has one important consequence - objects of different _types_ can have the same **method** or even the same _interface_. This is referred to as **polymorphism** - the ability to access objects of different types through the same interface, i.e. using the same method name on objects of different types with the correct implementation being automatically determined.

In Python, it is _not necessary_ that polymorphic methods have the **same return type and arguments in all classes**, but it is good practice to have the same arguments and return types - more consistent for external users to work with. The _method name_, _arguments_ and _return type_ form the **signature** of that method.

For example, if `Dog`, `Cat` and `Horse` all have a `speak()` method, and we have a _list_ of objects that are either a `Dog`, `Cat` or `Horse`, we can safely call `.speak()` on every object in the list.
