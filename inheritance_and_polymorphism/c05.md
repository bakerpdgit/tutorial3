# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 5 (task)

Complete the code to make the `Vehicle`, `Car`, `ElectricCar` and `Bicycle` classes.

All classes should have their own **description** method implemented so we can use *polymorphism* to call the description method on all objects.

All class attributes should be *protected*

- A car is a *vehicle*
- An electric car is a *car*
- A bicycle is a *vehicle*
