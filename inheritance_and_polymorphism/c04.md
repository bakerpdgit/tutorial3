# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 4 (example)

Since inheritance is a "***is a***" relationship, we can assign the *type* of the **superclass** to an instance of its subclass, e.g. `dog : Animal = Dog()`. This makes sense because a dog *is an* `Animal`!

This allows us to treat classes *related by inheritance* in the **same way** - this is *object-oriented* polymorphism. This is a kind of **run-time polymorphism**, as which *implementation* of the method to run is determined at *run-time* depending on what the object actually is. 

There are benefits of this approach to polymorphism:

1. Similar attributes, method signatures and code across classes can now be implemented in the **superclass** and inherited - reducing code duplication.
2. We can now assign a single concrete **data type** to all the subclasses

Subclasses can **redefine** inherited methods from the superclass - this is known as **method overriding**. For example, we are using `speak()` for all subclasses of `Animal`, so it makes sense to define `speak()` in the superclass. However, `speak()` is implemenetd differently in each subclass, so we can *skip the implementation* and **override** the method in each subclass.

A method in the superclass that *can be overrided* is known as a **virtual method**. In Python, **all methods are virtual** so we don't need to specify it, but in other languages there is a `virtual` keyword to specify that a method is virtual.
