# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 3 (example)

One of the **core pillars of OOP** is inheritance - the process of creating **subtypes** that *extend* the interface. When class $B$ inherits from class $A$, class $B$ automatically contains all the **public and protected** methods & attributes from class $A$, and it is free to define its own methods or even redefine inherited methods. In this case, class $B$ is called the **subclasss** and class $A$ is called the **superclass**.

In Python, inheritance is denoted by placing the **superclass** in *brackets* following the subclass' name. `super()` refers to the *instance* of the superclass. Often, the first thing you do in the subclass' constructor is call the superclass' constructor via `super().__init__(<args>)`.

The *protected specifier* allows attributes/methods to be **not externally accessible** but still accessible within the same class or its subclasses. Since normally attributes are private, subclasses **do not get access** to the attributes of the superclass. Protected offers a solution to this problem.

Inheritance is often thought of a "***is a***" relationship, e.g. `Moderator` is a `User`, and `Admin` is a `Moderator`. In contrast, composition is thought of as a "***has a***" relationship, e.g. a `Car` has an `Engine`.
