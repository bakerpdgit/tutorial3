# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 2 (task)

**Polymorphism** as referred to in *Exercise 1* is not the only *kind* of polymorphism. When **two unrelated objects share the same interface**, it is said to use *ad-hoc polymorphism*. *Ad-hoc polymorphism* is a **conceptual classification** - we will see a different conceptual classification in the next exercise.

We can also classify polymorphism by its **implementation** - whether it is *runtime* or *compile-time*. In Python, there is **no compile time resolution** so all polymorphism is *runtime*, but this can vary between languages.

*Ad-hoc polymorphism* is actually very broad - one example of *ad-hoc polymorphism* is **function overloading**. This is when functions have the same name and return type but have different arguments, and which *version* of the function is decided at **compile-time**. Python does not have function overloading, but other languages do.

A closely related form of *ad-hoc polymorphism* is **operator overloading** - this is present in python through **special methods**. Any method beginning and ending with two underscores `__` are *special* - for example, the `__init__` and `__repr__` methods are special.

In Python, **every operator**, such as `+`, `-`, etc. can be *extended* to user-defined classes via special methods. For example, the `+` operator is overloaded using the `__add__` method, and the `==` operator is overloaded using the `__eq__` method. This allows us to use the `+`, `==` operators on our own classes as well.

Fill in the blanks to make `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes both have the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods. In addition, define the `__eq__` special method for both classes, where two classes are considered *equal* if their attributes are equal in any order. E.g. `Rectangle(3, 4)` is the same as `Rectangle(4, 3)`. Note the use of the `isinstance` function, which checks if an object is an instance of a given class.

### Note

Conceptual classifications of polymorphism are beyond the A-Level specification. For A-Level purposes, polymorphism is just when objects of different types share the same interface.

In OOP, when we refer to *polymorphism* generally, we refer to **inheritance-based** polymorphism that we will see in the next exercise. Using *unrelated objects with the same interface* is **not common** in Object-Oriented languages like `Java`, as *union types* (types separated by a bar `|`) are not typical OOP features.
