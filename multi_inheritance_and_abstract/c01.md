# Multi-Inheritance and Abstract Classes

## Exercise 1 (example)

> This is the **fifth** chapter on OOP

In the **fourth** chapter on OOP, we've seen *linear* inheritance hierarchies - a class only inherits from **one other class**. In many OOP languages, some form of **multiple-inheritance** is allowed - when a class inherits from multiple classes. As we will see, this is an *extremely controversial* topic, as there are many *benefits* and *disadvantages*. Due to this, different languages support multiple inheritance in different ways.

One usecase of multiple inheritance is **mixin classes** - classes that aren't meant to be instantiated on their own, but provide a behaviour that other classes can inherit from. For example, we can make a `PrintableMixin` class that implements a *string representation method*. Classes can additionally inherit from `PrintableMixin` to *automatically add* a default string representation behaviour.

This allows for more **code reuse**, as we can write the method once and inherit for any other class that needs that behaviour.

To use multiple inheritance in Python, put the **superclasses** in the *brackets* after the class' name, separated by commas.

### Note

Multi-inheritance is **NOT** on the A-Level specification, but it links well with abstract classes.
