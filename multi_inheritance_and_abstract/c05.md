# Multi-Inheritance and Abstract Classes

## Exercise 5 (example)

One of the **most powerful** ways to use abstract classes is to define *interfaces* for classes - a contract that says a class must have a set of given methods. This can be used to *explicitly state* that objects are **supposed to be used in the same way** through polymorphism, and provides a tool for documentation.

An interface can be defined as an **abstract class with only abstract methods and no attributes** - i.e. a collection of methods that an inherited class must implement.

In addition, interfaces also work well with multiple inheritance. Since interfaces **do not contain any implementation**, inheriting from *multiple* interfaces **does not cause the diamond problem**. Even if multiple interfaces contain the same method, they *don't have any implementation*, so there is **no ambiguity**. Hence, we can use *interfaces* to provide **combine different behaviours** similar to *Mixins*.
