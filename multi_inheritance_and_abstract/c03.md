# Multi-Inheritance and Abstract Classes

## Exercise 3 (task)

One of the most *important* principles of OOP is "**favour composition over inheritance**". Often, inheritance is *overused* and this can lead to extremely deep inheritance hierarchies and a lot of mess with multiple inheritance problems (e.g. the diamond problem). This causes a few issues:

1. Code is not reuse friendly - a change in a method in the base class can lead to changes in every subclass
2. Code is difficult to follow - especially with multiple inheritance, increases complexity by a lot
3. Often not all object relationships are "**is a**", and trying to fit in inheritance can overcomplicate things

We can rewrite the moving attacking player as seen in *Exercise 2* using **composition** instead, which avoids the *diamond problem*. Instead, we can make `MoveBehaviour` and `AttackBehaviour` classes to handle each behaviour separately, and **set** them inside the `Player` class through composition. Since the `MoveBehaviour` class requires setting the *coordinate* of the player, we make a `Character` class that exposes a setter for the coordinate attribute, and use `Character` inside `Player` via composition. This way, we can maintain encapsulation of the `Player` object.

Fill in the blanks to use composition instead of inheritance.

### Note

The character class is named `_Character` to indicate that it is an *internal* class and should not be instantiated. If this was a **library**, we could omit `_Character` from the *export list* to maintain encapsulation.
