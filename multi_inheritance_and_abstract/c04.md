# Multi-Inheritance and Abstract Classes

## Exercise 4 (example)

Sometimes, a method in a class within an inheritance hierarchy **does not have any meaningful implementation** and should not be implemented. This can be achieved by **abstract methods** - methods that raise an error if called. The only way to *use the abstract method* is to **implement** it via *method overriding* in the subclass. 

In python, an abstract method is denoted using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. However, this alone is not enough to prevent external code from instantiating it - for this you will need to make the class containing the method inherit from `ABC`, which stands for *Abstract Base Class*. An **abstract class** is a class that contains *one or more* abstract methods, and cannot be instantiated, only inherited from. 

Using abstract classes and methods is *good practice* as it prevents users from instantiating classes that **do not have any real life meaning**, and are only for inheritance purposes. We will see that abstract classes can do more than *preventing users from using certain classes*.

### Note

Both `@abstractmethod` and `ABC` come from the default python library `abc`.
