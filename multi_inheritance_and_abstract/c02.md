# Multi-Inheritance and Abstract Classes

## Exercise 2 (task)

Often when working with inheritance, you may want features from multiple classes in an inheritance hierarchy - **multiple inheritance** can be used for this. However, a *severe flaw* known as the **diamond problem** can be encountered - when a class inherits the **same method** from multiple superclasses, with possibly different implementations. The question is now, which *version* is used?

Python resolves this problem using **Method Resolution Ordering** - a method to determine *which* version to call depending on the **order** of the superclasses provided in the brackets. Although this method ensures *consistency*, it can often cause **confusion** as to what happens when any *shared superclass method is invoked* - including the constructor `super().__init__()`.

Fill in the blanks to make `MoveableCharacter` and `AttackingCharacter` inherit from `Character`, and `MovingAttackingCharacter` inherit from both `MoveableCharacter` and `AttackingCharacter`. In addition, `Character`, `MoveableCharacter` and `AttackingCharacter` should each inherit from `PrintableMixin`, which provides a `__repr__` method.

Notice what happens when we **print** an instance of `MovingAttackingCharacter` - it does not define `__repr__` directly, so it has **two possible implementations** for `__repr__` that are inherited.

We can also see the **method resolution ordering** for the `MovingAttackingCharacter` class using the `__mro__` attribute - notice how the **MRO** depends on the *order* the superclasses are provided in.
