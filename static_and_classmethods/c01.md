# Static and Class Methods

## Exercise 1 (example)

Often, a class may contain *helper* or *utility* methods that *belong in the class* but do not use any class attributes. These methods can be implemented as **static methods** - methods that *belong to a class definition* but **are not part of the objects it creates**. Hence, static methods *do not* pass `self` as the first argument, and referencing any attribute or method that belongs to the class' *object* is **not allowed**.

In Python, static methods are written using the builtin `@staticmethod` decorator, and the `self` parameter is **not passed**.

Along with static methods, there are also **static attributes** that are not part of the object the class creates. These attributes are defined *without the use* of the `self` keyword. Typically, they are defined **after** the class name but *before* the constructor. Outside the class, these attributes can be accessed via `class.attribute`, and inside the class they can be accessed as `self.attribute`. 

Static attributes are often used to write **class constants** - constants that belong to a specific class. Classes can also have static attributes on their own, these are often used to *group together* related constants. This can be further extended to **enums** - A class used to store contstants with associated values. To use *enums*, make a class that inherits from `Enum`, which is imported from the `enum` module.
