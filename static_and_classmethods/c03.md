# Static and Class Methods

## Exercise 3 (example)

One other common usecase for **classmethods** is writing *alternative constructors*. Since Python *does not* have function overloading, we cannot write more than *one* constructor. Hence, *classmethods* are often used to write alternative constructors that **return** an instance of the class - they are essentially factory methods!

Technically *staticmethods* would also work for this purpose, but it is *not friendly* to inheritance since we would have to **hardcode** the class in the static method. When using a classmethod, we can use use `cls()` to create an instance of the same class.
