# Static and Class Methods

## Exercise 2 (task)

Static methods can sometimes be used for factory generator methods to create instances of another class.

This pattern can be helpful to centralise the creation of classes in order to store them together or apply validation.

Complete the code to show how static methods are used in OOP.

You will notice that is also includes a demonstration of the `@classmethod` decorator. A **classmethod** is also a method bound to the class not the object, but **must** take the *class* as the first argument, written as `cls`. In fact, you could replace the method with the following and it would still work:

```
  @staticmethod
  def get_product(name):
    return Product._registry.get(name)
```

However using `@classmethod` as shown is better practice because it would allow better for inheritance, e.g. with a class `SpecialProduct(Product)`, which could then override its implementation.

In general, **classmethods** are used for *factory methods* - methods that *return* instances of classes, and **staticmethods** are used for *utility functions* - functions that *belong* in a class for organisational purposes.
