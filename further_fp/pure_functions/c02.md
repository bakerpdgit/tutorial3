# Pure functions

## Exercise 2 (example)

In programming, functions can do a lot of things:
- Perform a computation on their arguments and return a result
But also:
- Read from state that wasn't passed in as an argument
- Modify state to create an observable effect other than through the return value
- Write text to the screen
- Behave differently depending on what the user inputs or at random

All these capabilities allow us to write functions like `next_number` opposite, which have a different return value each
time they are called.

In mathematics, on the other hand, functions are deterministic. If `f(2) = 4`, then that identity is true for all
occurrences of `f(2)` (or of `4`). There is no mathematical function equivalent to `next_number`.

We call a function "pure" if it is equivalent to some mathematical function â€“ that is, its value depends only on its
arguments whenever it is called, and its effect on the outside world is only through its return value.

Pure functions are easier to model mathematically, but also easier to work with for a programmer, as all their inputs
and outputs are made explicit.

Observe how `impure_function_2` and `impure_function_3` can be rewritten as pure functions by:
- Making inputs explicit as parameters
- Making outputs explicit as return values

To handle functions like `impure_function_1`, which have additional side effects such as printing, we will have to wait
until we have developed more theory.
