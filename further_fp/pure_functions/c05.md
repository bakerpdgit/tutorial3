# Pure functions

## Exercise 5 (task)

Rewrite the program opposite to use only pure functions.

For each function:
- Identify all cases where the function reads from external state not passed in as a parameter, and add an additional
  parameter for each variable accessed
- If any mutable objects are parameters, copy them with `copy.deepcopy` within the function.
- Identify all cases where the function modifies external state. Rewrite the function to make those modifications
  locally instead, then return the new values of the modified variables. If multiple variables are modified, or if the
  function already has a return value, return a tuple, with the original return value first.

For each usage of a modified function:
- Pass in the additional parameters. If the usage occurs within another function, that function may gain additional
  inputs which must also be realised as parameters.
- Capture the new values of modified variables and update the external state as necessary
- If the original return value of the function is used, capture it into a variable called `result`, and pass that
  variable on as necessary

The behaviour of the original code should end up preserved, but it's likely to be more intuitive in the new code than
in the old.
