# Pure functions

## Exercise 3 (task)

Rewrite the program opposite to use pure functions.

For each function:
- Identify all cases where the function reads from external state not passed in as a parameter, and add an additional
  parameter for each variable accessed
- Identify all cases where the function modifies external state. Rewrite the function to make those modifications
  locally instead, then return the new values of the modified variables. If multiple variables are modified, return a
  tuple.

For each usage of a modified function:
- Pass in the additional parameters
- Capture the new values of modified variables and update the external state as necessary
