# Interlude: proof by induction

## Exercise 2 (task)

The function `double` is defined inductively. For a given natural `n`, `double(n)` is defined as follows:
- In the case that `n ≡ 0`: `double(0) ≡ 0`
- In the case that `n ≡ succ(k)`: `double(n) ≡ succ(succ(double(k)))`

Arrange the blocks to prove that for any natural `n`, `double(n)` is even. Put the base case (`n ≡ 0`) before the
inductive step (`n ≡ succ(k)`).
