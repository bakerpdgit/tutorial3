# Interlude: proof by induction

## Exercise 5 (task)

The function `concat` takes two arguments, both lists, and concatenates them. It is defined inductively on the first
argument:
- If `l ≡ nil` then `concat(l, m) ≡ m`
- If `l ≡ x : xs` then `concat(l, m) ≡ x : concat(xs, m)`

Rearrange the lines to prove that for any list `l`, `concat(l, nil) ≡ l` (so concatenating the empty list on the end of
a list does nothing). As before, put the base case before the inductive step.
