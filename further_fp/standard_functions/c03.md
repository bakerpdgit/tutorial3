# Functional programming: standard functions

## Exercise 3 (task)

Rewrite the functions opposite in terms of composition and standard functions.

The file should not contain any `lambda`s or `def`s, so you should not name the arguments to your functions. (This is
called "point-free" style, thinking of the arguments to the function as "points" at which they are evaluated.)
Instead, think about what the functions are doing, and try to understand that behaviour as applying a sequence of
standard functions.

For example,
- `plus_two = lambda x: x + 2` could be written as `plus_two = succ |compose| succ`, because
  `(succ |compose| succ)(x) ≡ succ(succ(x)) ≡ succ(x + 1) ≡ x + 1 + 1 ≡ x + 2`
- `second_of_three = lambda x: lambda y: lambda z: y` could be written as `second_of_three = const(const)`, because
  `const(const)(x)(y)(z) ≡ const(y)(z) ≡ y`
