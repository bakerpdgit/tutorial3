# Functional programming: standard functions

## Exercise 6 (task)

Once more, rewrite the functions opposite in terms of the standard functions
`idem, const, succ, |compose|, nfold_compose, curry, uncurry`, without using any `lambda`s or `def`s.

For example:
- `first_of_three = lambda x: lambda y: lambda z: x` could be written as `const |compose| const`
