# Functional style: variables

## Exercise 2 (task)

Rewrite the program opposite to remove all variables, by simply re-evaluating what the variable would be at each usage.
Do not simplify or rearrange any algebraic expressions.

Note that, since all functions are pure, we never need to cache its value. We can safely call it again each time the
value is used. (Again, performance is not a concern; we trust the compiler to optimise away any inefficiencies this
causes.)
