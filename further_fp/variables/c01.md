# Functional style: variables

## Exercise 1 (example)

One justification for pure functions is that they correspond to mathematical functions. We desire that `f(2)` has the
same value wherever it occurs.

Despite our efforts, this is still not true! In fact, in programming, it is not even true that `y` has the same meaning
wherever it occurs, because variables may be reassigned.

In a sense, variable assignment is not a pure function, as it effects the value of the variable in the scope in which
it is performed. A key idea of functional programming is that **everything** should be a pure function, so we forbid
variable assignment.

> That "everything" in the last chapter meant all functions. In this chapter, it means all code, and in due course it

In the next example we will devise a method to reintroduce variables from a functional perspective, but for now we will
not use them.
