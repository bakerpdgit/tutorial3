# Functional style: variables

## Exercise 4 (task)

Rewrite the code from exercise 2 to now use `let` statements to bind each identifier, rather than assigning variables.
Keep all the same variable names, and as before, do not simplify or rearrange any algebraic expressions.

Note that while it sometimes makes sense to nest `let` statements, if one variable is used in the computation of
another, it is not useful to put `let` statements one after the other. After all, what statement would go inside the
first `let`? It could not be anything with side effects, nor could it be a local variable assignment, nor a `return`
statement.
