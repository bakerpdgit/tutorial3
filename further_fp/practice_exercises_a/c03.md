# Functional programming practice exercises set A

## Exercise 3 (task)

Opposite is an example solution to the previous exercise.

Rewrite `repeat_first_element`, `tail`, and `drop` to use functional lists with `nil` and `**` rather than mutable
lists. Recall how to use `match... case...` to unwrap one `**` at a time:
```python3
match lst:
    case nil.nil: pass
    case Cons(x, xs): pass
```
