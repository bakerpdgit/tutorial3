## Exercise 1 (task)

Rewrite the program opposite to make all functions pure:
- Make inputs explicit by passing as parameters anything that the function reads
- Make outputs explicit by including any desired changes to the external state in the return
  value, and performing them outside the function.
- If a function has a return value and side effects, put them together in a tuple with the original return value first
