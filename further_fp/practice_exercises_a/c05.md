## Exercise 5 (task)

Below the functions `tail` and `repeat_first_element` are defined mathematically:

```
tail(nil) ≡ nil
tail(x : xs) ≡ xs

repeat_first_element(nil) ≡ nil
repeat_first_element(x : xs) ≡ x : x : xs
```

Arrange the lines opposite to prove that `tail ∘ repeat_first_element ≡ idem`.

Also think about why `repeat_first_element ∘ tail` is not equivalent to `idem`.
