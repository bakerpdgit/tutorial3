# Functional programming: lists

## Exercise 1 (example)

We return to Python. Recall that mutable objects can create side effects: if a function is passed a mutable object, it
must make a local copy or any modifications to the object will be reflected in the external state and hence be side
effects.

To use lists in functional programming, therefore, we want to redefine lists to be immutable. We can use the inductive
definition we have just seen.

We define a list as either:
- The empty list, called `nil`; or
- The first element `x` of the list, followed by the rest of the list `xs`. We write this `x ** xs`.

`:` is not a valid operator in Python so we use `**`. If you prefer, you can write `x ** xs` as `Cons(x, xs)`, but I
think the infix `**` will prove much easier to use.
