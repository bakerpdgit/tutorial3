# Functional programming: lists

## Exercise 2 (example)

In the previous chapter we defined the functions `sum` and `concat` inductively on lists.
To translate these functions into Python, we just need a way to tell whether a list is `nil` or `x:xs`, and, in the
latter case, extract `x` and `xs`. Since we have constructed lists out of tuples, we can use `match... case...` to do
this. The `nil` case uses `nil.nil` due to Python's syntactic restrictions, but `nil.nil is nil`.
