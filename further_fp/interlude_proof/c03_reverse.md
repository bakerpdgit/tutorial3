(f ∘ (g ∘ h))(x)
≡ f((g ∘ h)(x))              substituting in the definition of composition
≡ f(g(h(x)))                 substituting in the definition of composition
≡ (f ∘ g)(h(x))              substituting out the definition of composition
≡ ((f ∘ g) ∘ h)(x)           substituting out the definition of composition
⇒ f ∘ (g ∘ h) ≡ (f ∘ g) ∘ h  by extensional equiality
