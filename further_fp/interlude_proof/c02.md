# Interlude: proof

## Exercise 2 (task)

In the previous page, we wrote a proof that `f ∘ idem ≡ f` for any function `f`.

Now, arrange the lines opposite to complete a proof that for any function `f`, `f ≡ idem ∘ f`.

Check the formatting of the proof on the previous page to try and copy it here. Due to technical limitations only one
proof can be accepted even if multiple are logically valid, so you will need to, eg, put the base case of the induction
before the inductive step.

To make the challenge slightly harder, I have split the first line in two, and I've also started my manipulation from
`f` rather than `idem ∘ f`, so that definitions are substituted "out" rather than "in".
