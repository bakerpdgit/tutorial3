# Interlude: proof

## Exercise 3 (task)

Rearrange the lines to complete the proof that for all functions `f`, `g`, and `h`, `f ∘ (g ∘ h) ≡ (f ∘ g) ∘ h`.

> This property, that brackets can be rearranged in this way without rearranging objects, is called associativity.
> Combined with the previous two properties about `idem`, this shows that composition is a **monoid**, which we will
> define later.
